# Win32-Hill-Climbing-Program
Made by Joshua Tanner
Media Design School 2016

A simple program which uses a hill climbing algorithm to find an optimal route between 8 cities, presented using Windows GDI programming.

The user can begin the hill climb with a left click, or randomly generate new coordinates for the 8 cities with a right click.

Note: The algorithm will not always find the shortest path between cities due to the nature of hill climbing and its tendency to 
become stuck at local maxima.
